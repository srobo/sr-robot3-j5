Servo Board
===========

The kit can control multiple servos simultaneously. One Servo Board can
control up to twelve servos.

Accessing the Servo Board
-------------------------

The servo board can be accessed using the ``servo_board`` property of
the ``Robot`` object.

.. code:: python

   my_servo_board = r.servo_board

This board object has an array containing the servos connected to it,
which can be accessed as ``servos[0]``, ``servos[1]``, ``servos[2]``, etc. 
The servo board is labelled so you know which servo is which.

.. Hint:: Remember that arrays start counting at 0.

Setting servo positions
-----------------------

The position of servos can range from ``-1`` to ``1`` inclusive:

.. code:: python

   # set servo 1's position to 0.2
   r.servo_board.servos[1].position = 0.2

   # Set servo 2's position to -0.55
   r.servo_board.servos[2].position = -0.55

You can read the last value a servo was set to using similar code:

.. code:: python

   last_position = r.servo_board.servos[11].position

.. attention:: While it is possible to retrieve the last position a servo was set to,
   this does not guarantee that the servo is currently in that position.

How the set position relates to the servo angle
-----------------------------------------------

.. danger::

   You should be careful about forcing a servo to drive past its end
   stops. Some servos are very strong and it could damage the internal
   gears.

The angle of an RC servo is controlled by the width of a pulse supplied
to it periodically. There is no standard for the width of this pulse and
there are differences between manufacturers as to what angle the servo
will turn to for a given pulse width. To be able to handle the widest
range of all servos our hardware outputs a very wide range of pulse
widths which in some cases will force the servo to try and turn past its
internal end-stops. You should experiment and find what the actual limit
of your servos are (it almost certainly won't be -1 and 1) and not
drive them past that.
