Motor Board
===========

The kit can control multiple motors simultaneously. One Motor Board can
control up to two motors.

Accessing the Motor Board
-------------------------

If there is exactly one motor board attached to your robot, it can be accessed 
using the ``motor_board`` property of the ``Robot`` object.

.. code:: python

   my_motor_board = r.motor_board

.. Warning:: If there is more than one motor board on your kit, you *must* use the
  ``motor_boards`` property. ``r.motor_board`` *will cause an error*. This is because 
  the kit doesn't know which motor board you want to access.

Motor boards attached to your robot can be accessed under the ``motor_boards`` 
property of the ``Robot``. The boards are indexed by their serial number, which is written on the board.

.. code:: python
  
  my_motor_board = r.motor_boards["sr1KT1V"]
  my_other_motor_board = r.motor_boards["sr1NN4L"]

Controlling the Motor Board
---------------------------

This board object has an array containing the motors connected to it,
which can be accessed as ``motors[0]`` and ``motors[1]``. The Motor Board is labelled so you know which
motor is which.

.. code:: python

   my_motor_board.motors[0]
   my_motor_board.motors[1]

Powering motors
---------------

Motor power is controlled using `pulse-width modulation
(PWM) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation>`__. You set
the power with a fractional value between ``-1`` and ``1`` inclusive,
where ``1`` is maximum speed in one direction, ``-1`` is maximum speed
in the other direction and ``0`` causes the motor to brake.

.. code:: python

   my_motor_board.motors[0].power = 1
   my_motor_board.motors[1].power = -1

These values can also be read back:

.. code:: python

   my_motor_board.motors[0].power
   >>> 1

   my_motor_board.motors[1].power
   >>> -1

.. Warning:: Setting a value outside of the range ``-1`` to
   ``1`` will raise an exception and your code will crash.

.. Danger:: Sudden large changes in the motor speed setting
   (e.g. ``-1`` to ``0``, ``1`` to ``-1`` etc.) will likely trigger the
   over-current protection and your robot will shut down with a distinct beeping
   noise and/or a red light next to the power board output that is powering
   the motor board.

Special values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the numeric values, there are two special constants that
can be used: ``BRAKE`` and ``COAST``. In order to use these, they must
be imported from the ``sr.robot3`` module like so:

.. code:: python

   from sr.robot3 import BRAKE, COAST

``BRAKE``
^^^^^^^^^

``BRAKE`` will stop the motors from turning, and thus stop your robot as
quick as possible.

.. Hint:: ``BRAKE`` does the same as setting the power to ``0``.

.. code:: python

   from sr.robot3 import BRAKE

   my_motor_board.motors[0].power = BRAKE

``COAST``
^^^^^^^^^

``COAST`` will stop applying power to the motors. This will mean they
continue moving under the momentum they had before.

.. code:: python

   from sr.robot3 import COAST

   my_motor_board.motors[1].power = COAST
