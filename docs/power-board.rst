Power Board
===========

The power board can be accessed using the ``power_board`` property of
the ``Robot`` object.

.. code:: python

   my_power_board = r.power_board

Power Outputs
-------------

The six outputs of the power board are grouped together as ``power_board.outputs``.

The power board's six outputs can be turned on and off using the
``power_on`` and ``power_off`` functions of the group respectively.

.. Hint:: ``power_on`` is called when you setup your robot, so
   this doesn't need to be called manually. The ports will come on
   automatically as soon as your robot is ready, before the start button is
   pressed.

.. code:: python

   r.power_board.outputs.power_off()
   r.power_board.outputs.power_on()


You can also get information about and control each output in the group.
An output is indexed using the position from the following list:

- ``OUT_H0`` - High Current Output H0
- ``OUT_H1`` - High Current Output H1
- ``OUT_L0`` - High Current Output L0
- ``OUT_L1`` - High Current Output L1
- ``OUT_L2`` - High Current Output L2
- ``OUT_L3`` - High Current Output L3

.. code:: python

   from sr.robot3 import *

   r.power_board.outputs[OUT_H0].is_enabled = True
   r.power_board.outputs[OUT_L3].is_enabled = False
   
   boolean_value = r.power_board.outputs[OUT_L2].is_enabled

   current_amps = r.power_board.outputs[OUT_H2].current

.. Warning:: The motor and servo boards are powered through these
   power outputs, whilst the power is off, you won't be able to control
   your motors or servos. They will register as a missing board and your code will
   break if you try and control them.

Battery Sensor
--------------

The power board has some sensors that can monitor the status of your battery.
This can be useful for checking the charge status of your battery.

.. code:: python
   
   battery_voltage = r.power_board.battery_sensor.voltage
   battery_current_amps = r.power_board.battery_sensor.current

Buzzing üêù
----------

The power board has a piezo sounder which can buzz.

The ``buzz`` function accepts multiple parameters, depending on what you
want to play. The first argument is the duration of the beep, in
seconds. The later arguments are either the note you want to play, or
the frequency of the buzzer (in Hertz). You have to specify which of note
or frequency you're passing using a keyword argument, your code will
fail otherwise.

Theoretically, the piezo buzzer will buzz at any provided frequency,
however humans can only hear between `20Hz and
20000Hz <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_range#Humans>`__.

The ``Note`` enum provides notes in `scientific pitch notation
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation>`__ between
``C6`` and ``C8``. You can play other tones by providing a frequency.

.. Hint:: Calling ``buzz`` is non-blocking, which means it doesn't
   actually wait for the piezo to stop buzzing before continuing with your
   code. If you want to wait for the buzzing to stop, add a
   ``sleep`` afterwards! If you send more than 32 beeps to the robot too 
   quickly, your power board will crash!

.. code:: python

   from sr.robot3 import Note

   # Buzz for half a second in D6.
   r.power_board.piezo.buzz(0.5, Note.D6)

   # Buzz for 2 seconds at 400Hz
   r.power_board.piezo.buzz(2, 400)


Start Button
------------

You can manually wait for the start button to be pressed, not only at
the start.

.. code:: python

   r.wait_start()

This may be useful for debugging, but be sure to remove it in the
competition, as you won't be allowed to touch the start button after a match has begun!
